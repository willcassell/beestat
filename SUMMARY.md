# Beestat API Integration - Project Summary

## What We Built

A comprehensive Python client for the Beestat API that extracts **all available thermostat data** in a single API call and presents it in both human-readable and machine-parseable formats.

## Key Findings

### ✅ Single API Call Does Everything

After analyzing the Beestat API documentation and source code, we determined that:

**You only need ONE API call to get comprehensive thermostat data:**
```
GET https://api.beestat.io/?api_key={KEY}&resource=thermostat&method=read_id
```

This single endpoint returns:
- Current status (temperature, humidity, setpoints, running equipment)
- Real-time weather data
- Property information
- HVAC system configuration
- All comfort settings and schedules
- One year of historical analytics
- Maintenance information and alerts
- Filter status and reminders

### Optional Additional Resources

We also documented 3 additional API resources that provide specialized data:
1. **runtime_thermostat_summary** - Daily historical summaries
2. **runtime_thermostat** - 5-minute interval data (troubleshooting)
3. **sensor** - Individual room sensor readings

**These are NOT needed for general thermostat monitoring** - they're only useful for specialized use cases like historical trend analysis or detailed troubleshooting.

## Files Created

### 1. `fetch_beestat_comprehensive.py` ⭐ **RECOMMENDED**
The main script that:
- Makes a single API call to get all thermostat data
- Parses and organizes the data into comprehensive records
- Creates one complete record per thermostat
- Displays formatted output with all information
- Saves both raw and parsed JSON files
- Calculates derived metrics (efficiency, system summary, etc.)

**No external dependencies required** - uses only Python standard library!

### 2. Supporting Scripts
- `fetch_beestat_simple.py` - Simplified version with basic data only
- `fetch_beestat.py` - Alternative using `requests` library

### 3. Documentation
- `README.md` - User guide with usage instructions
- `API_GUIDE.md` - Complete API reference
- `SUMMARY.md` - This file (project overview)

## Data Extracted Per Thermostat

Each thermostat record includes:

### Core Status (13 fields)
```
temperature, humidity, setpoint_heat, setpoint_cool, running_equipment,
hvac_state, current_climate_details, etc.
```

### Location & Property (6 fields)
```
latitude, longitude, age, square_feet, stories, structure_type
```

### Weather Data (9 fields)
```
condition, temperature, temp_low, temp_high, humidity, wind_speed,
wind_bearing, dew_point, barometric_pressure
```

### System Configuration (3+ fields)
```
cooling_system (stages/type), heating_system (stages/type),
auxiliary_heat, differentials
```

### Programs & Schedule (3+ complex objects)
```
all comfort settings (Home/Away/Sleep), weekly schedule,
active sensors per climate
```

### Historical Analytics (8+ metrics)
```
total_runtime per equipment type, heating/cooling degree days,
runtime per degree day, balance points, efficiency metrics
```

### Maintenance (2+ fields)
```
filter info (last changed, life remaining),
active alerts, inspection reminders
```

### System Info (8 fields)
```
thermostat_id, ecobee_id, user_id, time_zone, sync timestamps,
data availability range, status flags
```

## Usage

### Quick Start
```bash
python3 fetch_beestat_comprehensive.py
```

### Output Files Generated
- `beestat_raw_{timestamp}.json` - Complete API response
- `beestat_comprehensive_{timestamp}.json` - Parsed data

### Configuration
Edit these variables in the script:
```python
BEESTAT_API_KEY = "your_key_here"
TARGET_THERMOSTATS = ["Downstairs", "809 Sailors Cove"]  # or None for all
```

## Key Insights

### 1. API Design
The Beestat API is extremely well-designed:
- Single call returns comprehensive data
- No need for multiple requests
- Includes historical analytics (not just current status)
- Weather data integrated
- Maintenance tracking built-in

### 2. Data Richness
The data available is far more comprehensive than expected:
- One year of runtime analytics
- Efficiency metrics calculated
- Temperature deltas and balance points
- Full weekly schedules
- Equipment-specific runtime totals

### 3. No Additional Calls Needed
For thermostat monitoring and analytics:
- ✅ Use `thermostat.read_id` (single call)
- ❌ Don't need `runtime_thermostat_summary` (daily data already in profile)
- ❌ Don't need `runtime_thermostat` (unless debugging)
- ❌ Don't need `sensor` separately (sensor info in program climates)

## Target Thermostats in Your Setup

Based on the data retrieved:

### 1. Downstairs (Home - Richmond area)
- 3000 sq ft, 2-story detached home, 17 years old
- 1-stage compressor cooling/heating + electric auxiliary
- Coordinates: 37.52465, -77.63107

### 2. 809 Sailors Cove (Lake - Roanoke area)
- 1000 sq ft, 2-story condominium, 45 years old
- 1-stage compressor cooling/heating + electric auxiliary
- Coordinates: 37.05319, -79.61242

## Next Steps / Potential Enhancements

1. **Database Integration**: Store historical snapshots for trending
2. **Alerting System**: Notify on temperature thresholds or equipment issues
3. **Efficiency Dashboard**: Visualize runtime and efficiency metrics over time
4. **Multi-location Comparison**: Compare performance between Home and Lake properties
5. **Scheduled Polling**: Run automatically every 15 minutes and store results
6. **Cost Analysis**: Calculate estimated energy costs based on runtime data

## Technical Notes

- Python 3.6+ required
- No external dependencies (uses `urllib` from standard library)
- Handles API errors gracefully with retry logic
- Outputs both human-readable and JSON formats
- Filters thermostats by name (configurable)
- Tested and working with real data
